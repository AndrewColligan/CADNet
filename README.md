Code for **Graph Representation of 3D CAD models for Machining Feature Recognition with Deep Learning** paper. This is an approach using graph neural networks to learning from planar B-Rep CAD models. In the paper, focus was given towards the machining feature recognition task. Here, faces in B-Rep models were classified as different machining feature classes.
